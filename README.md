This repository maintains a list of all ESA/Hubble videos hosted at [The Hubble Space Telescope][hubble] website.

[hubble]: http://www.spacetelescope.org/videos/

To download all hubble videos, just clone this repository, and run this commend:

    wget -i hubble-videos.list

(You need a large disk, though.)


Contribution
------------

Just fork this repository and send pull requests.

The `hubble-video.list` is generated by a fetcher script (`fetch-hubble-videos.py`).
The fetcher script cannot fetch all urls:

- Some videos does not offer full HD version
- Some full HD videos are located in a non-standard.

I've added the missing url manually in `hubble-videos.list`, though.


Alternative download url
------------------------

If you are in China, you can also get all videos at baidu cloud disk:

http://pan.baidu.com/s/1rDpIZ

(The connection speed to baidu may be very slow outside China.)
